  "prompt": "You are an expert evaluator of web agent.\nYour task is to assess how helpful a given agent's THOUGHT and ACTION is in making progress toward the user's goal, based on the current state of the webpage.\n\n# Action space:\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n```click [id]```: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n```type [id] [content]```: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0, i.e., ```type [id] [content] [0]```.\n```hover [id]```: Hover over an element with id.\n```press [key_comb]```:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n```scroll [down]``` or ```scroll [up]```: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n```new_tab```: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n```tab_focus [tab_index]```: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n```close_tab```: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n```goto [url]```: Navigate to a specific URL.\n```go_back```: Navigate to the previously viewed page. Use this strategically when you need to return to a previous page to access different information or continue a multi-step task. For example, after examining a user's profile, use go_back to return to the user list and select the next user for analysis.\n```go_forward```: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n```stop [answer]```: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket.\n\nProgress Reporting Action:\n```send_msg_to_user(\"message\")```: Send a progress report or summary to the user. Use this to report intermediate findings, summarize collected information, or provide status updates. After sending a message, continue executing the task - do NOT stop. This is useful for multi-step tasks where you need to communicate progress while continuing to work toward the goal.\n\n# Task Description\nEvaluate how helpful the given thought and action is for achieving the goal.\nUse the following scale:\n**Scoring Criteria (1 to 5):**\n- **5 (Very Helpful)**: The action directly and effectively moves toward fulfilling a key part of the goal.\n- **4 (Helpful)**: The action contributes meaningfully to progress, though it may require follow-up actions.\n- **3 (Somewhat Helpful)**: The action is partially relevant or a preparatory step, but doesn't make immediate progress.\n- **2 (Slightly Helpful)**: The action is weakly related to the goal or might only indirectly help.\n- **1 (Not Helpful)**: The action is unrelated, redundant, or distracts from the goal.\n\n# Given Information\n\n## User Instruction\n{intent}\n\n## Trajectory\n{trajectory}\n\n## Current State\n### Current URL\n{current_url}\n\n### AXTREE\nNote: [id] is the unique numeric identifier at the beginning of lines for each element in the accessibility tree. Always use id to refer to elements in your actions.\n{text_observation}\n\n## Agent's Response\nTHOUGHT:\n{thought}\nACTION:\n{action}\n\n# Output Format\nPlease return your response in the following format:\nREASON:\n[Your explanation for the score]\nSCORE: [1-5]"
