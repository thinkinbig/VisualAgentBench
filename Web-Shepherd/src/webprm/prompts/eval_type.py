**Scoring Criteria (1 to 5):**
- **5 (Very Helpful)**: The action directly and effectively moves toward fulfilling a key part of the goal.
- **4 (Helpful)**: The action contributes meaningfully to progress, though it may require follow-up actions.
- **3 (Somewhat Helpful)**: The action is partially relevant or a preparatory step, but doesnâ€™t make immediate progress.

Use the task instruction, trajectory (including previously completed steps from history), current webpage state, and the agent's current response as evidence for your evaluation. Clearly consider any items already successfully completed or currently in progress according to the provided trajectory.
For each checklist item:
- Mark it as 'Yes' if it is clearly and fully satisfied either in the current response or already completed in the history.
- Mark it as 'In Progress' if the agent has made partial but meaningful progress toward completing the item.
- Mark it as 'No' if there is ambiguity, insufficient evidence, or the step is incomplete or not yet started."""
